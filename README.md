## MQTT Temperature, Atmospheric Pressure and Humidity sensor

The hardware used for that project:
  - ESP8266 Micro-Controller
  - BMP280 Atmospheric sensor
  - OLED ssd1306 mini display

The display and the sensor are using an I2C bus. The only thing I had
to do is plug the sensors into the power and on the two wires of the
I2C bus.
